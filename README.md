Welcome to the Hypixel Translators Bot GitHub repository!

# Localisation [![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/hypixel-translators-bot/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/hypixel-translators-bot)
The bot has a `+language` command which allows you to change your bot language. You can help translate the bot to your language! We've added all languages currently supported by Hypixel to the bot, plus some other ones requested by the community. If your language isn't supported yet, please let us know and we will work on implementing it.

## Want to help?
To join the translation project, please make a join request (link below) and include your Discord tag (QkeleQ10#6046 for example) or your Discord ID. If you don't include either of these you will be denied, even if we know who you are. This is so that we can give you access to the special channel made to discuss bot translations (#bot-translators).

## Just want to check it out?
In order to change your language, execute `+language <language>`. If you find any bugs, please let us know using `+bug`. Keep in mind you do not have to join the translation project in order to use the language, but it may not be fully translated.
